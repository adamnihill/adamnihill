## Computer Science and Data Analytics Portfolio

This github profile serves as a portfolio for the projects I have completed as part of the Computer Science and Data Analytics course at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. Each repository contains a demonstration of the skills I have acquired while undertaking this course. A link to these repositories, and a brief explanation of the projects, is contained below.

## [Web Application Development](https://github.com/adamnihill/web-application-development)

The purpose of the Web Application Development project was to demonstrate an understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This was achieved by creating a demo website for a fiction company. I have since applied the skills developed in this module to the creation of a website for a local company, linked [here](https://akcoops.netlify.app). This website is currently a work in progress but has been built using the fundamentals I learned creating the website for this project. 

## [Programming and Scripting](https://github.com/adamnihill/programming-and-scripting)

This repository contains an ivestigation into the Fisher Iris dataset. This is one of the best known databases to be found in pattern recognition literature, containing data on three Iris species, Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. Four features, petal length and width, and sepal length and width, were measured on fifty samples of each species. Fisher determined that one of the species was linearly separable from the other two. Python, and specifically the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, was used to visualise and describe the relationship between the Iris species. 

## [Programming for Data Analysis](https://github.com/adamnihill/programming-data-analysis)

This repository concerns the numpy.random package, used to generate random data in python. Included in this repository is a jupyter notebook that explains and visualised various functions of this package. There is particular interest paid towards the different types of distribution of randomly generated data and how these distributions may be applied to real world scenarios.
