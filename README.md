## Computer Science and Data Analytics Portfolio

This github profile serves as a portfolio for the projects I have completed as part of the Computer Science and Data Analytics course at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. Each repository contains a demonstration of the skills I have acquired while undertaking this course. A link to these repositories, and a brief explanation of the projects, is contained below.

## [Web Application Development](https://github.com/adamnihill/web-application-development)

The purpose of the Web Application Development project was to demonstrate an understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This was achieved by creating a demo website for a fiction company. I have since applied the skills developed in this module to the creation of a website for a local company, linked [here](https://akcoops.netlify.app). This website is currently a work in progress but has been built using the fundamentals I learned creating the website for this project. 

## [Programming and Scripting](https://github.com/adamnihill/programming-and-scripting)

This repository contains an ivestigation into the Fisher Iris dataset. This is one of the best known databases to be found in pattern recognition literature, containing data on three Iris species, Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. Four features, petal length and width, and sepal length and width, were measured on fifty samples of each species. Fisher determined that one of the species was linearly separable from the other two. Python, and specifically the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, was used to visualise and describe the relationship between the Iris species. 

## [Programming for Data Analysis](https://github.com/adamnihill/programming-data-analysis)

This repository concerns the numpy.random package, used to generate random data in python. Included in this repository is a jupyter notebook that explains and visualised various functions of this package. There is particular interest paid towards the different types of distribution of randomly generated data and how these distributions may be applied to real world scenarios.

## [Fundamentals of Data Analysis](https://github.com/adamnihill/fundamentals-data-analysis)

The Jupyter Notebook found in this repository explores the tips dataset based on the instructions found [here](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-fundda/raw/master/project.pdf). This dataset contains the tipping data of a restaurant over a four day period. The dataset contains seven variables: total bill, tip, smoker/non-smoker, sex, day, time, and party size. The notebook explores the relationship between these variables, with particular attention on their impact on the tip.

## [Machine Learning and Statistics](https://github.com/adamnihill/machine-learning-statistics)

This repository documents the creation of a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on a dataset provided for the project. The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests. This involved an examination of dataset, splitting dataset for for training, and training of a model in keras. This model was exported from Jupyter Notebook and imported to a Flask server which contains functions for making predictions based on input and routes for web server. Finally a HTML and CSS were used to create a web interface to make predictions based on user input.

## [Computational Thinking with Algorithms](https://github.com/adamnihill/computational-thinking-algorithms)

This repository contains an analysis of five sorting algorithms are examined, Bubble, Heap, Counting, Insertion, and Selection sort. These algorithms encompass simple comparison-based sorting(Bubble, Insertion, and Selection), efficient comarison-based sorting(Heap), and non comparison-based sorting(Counting). These algorithms are then compared using benchmarking code and the merits of each algorithm are discussed.

## [Data Representation and Querying](https://github.com/adamnihill/data-representation)

This repository contains the code for the Project for the module Data Representation and Querying. The primary function of this app is to provide the user with an interface to store the details of football players on a team. It contains two database access objects, SquadDAO and AuthDAO. The main Flask application is contained in the file server.py. The templates folder contains the html files for rendering the Flask application. initdb.sql contains the sql commands from creating the required tables in this project requirents.txt contain the venv requirements for the project
